Things I did:
Dark Mode Toggle
Unit Toggle + Needed Conversions
API Batching so that once the user leaves the Home Page, then the database is updated, rather than immediately after clicking the +25ml button / adding intake in other ways
db.json
Redux
No TS because I almost lost everything and I don't want to spike my cortisol, sorry
