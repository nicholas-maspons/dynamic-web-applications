// Here I will have styles for when we switch from Light and Dark mode. 'Okay i did it' -futute Nicholas

.app {
    // i forgot to include the bg color here as well and it drove me insane. I have three shades (one was the default white) and i didnt know why
    // this is not inherited so all children have transparent backgrounds, which I need to specify in their scss
    background-color: var(--bg);
    // only need to specify here, since color is inherited
    color: var(--text);
}

// these are available to everything including and inside the parent, which is the whole app in this case since App has this style (or dark) at all times
