### Week 03 Notes

(fix later, i just need to push SOMETHING)

- Tailwind
    - Notes on how to set it up: Add later
- Pages

- Extra
    - https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

    - add notes on how to get a project running by just copying src and json, then doing npm install. for somereason tailwind doesnt work. im misssing the config file and even then it didnt work. and the version i did install was 4. something while prof was 3. how did she get that

    - proptypes not working? delete that later maybe. or just leave the example since i think its correct

    - explain how the button in the pages vs button only example are slightly diff


but if i didn't have the json , tailwind config, and src, what steps would I have taken. I tried but ended up with a different tailwind version and nothing worked
rest: 
npm install classnames
npm install prop-types or npm i prop-types
npm install tailwind-merge
Or?
npm i tailwind-merge
